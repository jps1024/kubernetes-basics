  Pods, Services and IngressControllers
=========================================


##
## Simple pods, with their respective internal services, and where those services are
## exposed to the outside of the cluster through an Ingress Controller
##
kc apply -f 21-foo-bar.yaml
kc get all -n foo-bar-system
kc config set-context --current --namespace=foo-bar-system
kc get all -o wide
curl http://localhost:8080/foo
curl http://localhost:8080/bar
curl http://localhost:8080/dummy
kc get ingress.networking.k8s.io
kc describe ingress.networking.k8s.io/foo-bar-ingress


##
## A variant of the previous one, with the only difference that the services are headless
## whereby a stable internal IP address is not assigned to the service; instead, clients
## are redirected directly to the pod(s) implementing the service
##
kc delete ns foo-bar-system
kc apply -f 22-headless-foo-bar.yaml
